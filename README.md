ICHACK 2025 (1-2 Feb 2025)

An AI assistant that helps you centralise your search for multiple products/things of same characteristics online. Examples: particular size & colour basketball shoes, 2 bed flats in London.

Centralise multi-site searching of products of same characteristics through a browser extension that call an agentic AI.

We used an open source browsing use agentic AI repo: https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use that can control a Chromium tab to interact with and complete the task.

We used Claude as the base LLM for the task completions.
